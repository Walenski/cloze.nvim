Cloze.nvim is a set of tools designed to expedite the process of creating flashcards using neovim. The text, and particularly LaTeX equation editors in vanilla Anki are functional, but very slow. LaTeX users have already optimised the process of producing typeset documents and formulae - the consensus is that a combination of a modal text editor (e.g. Vim) and a snippet engine (ultisnips or luasnips) enables an experienced user to wrrite LaTeX at near the speed of thought. This project thus aims to bring the full force of these technologies to bear on flashcard creation.

Requirements:
AnkiConnect plugin (for https calls)
